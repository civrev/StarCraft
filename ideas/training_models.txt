before any attempt to build a model I need to know what data I'm working with
replays are the training data so by defualt I think I should start there for
deciphering this mess

Source Code:
https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2/blob/master/pysc2/bin/replay_actions.py

when you want to view a replay with all the acitons and what not that are in it
you use something like this
python3 -m pysc2.bin.replay_actions --replays="/home/christian/StarCraftII/Replays/fa53bca42064bc9185e1c6d280f6cb25c84c1b6e207a4cc2f70f2d50042caf89.SC2Replay"

so pysc2.bin.replay_actions looks like something that is already built to parse though
replay information.

so taking a look at the console it appears that what is written there comes from
the function stats_printer which grabs its information from a stats_queue

stats_queue is a global made at runtime in main function
stats_queue = multiprocessing.Queue()
stats_thread = threading.Thread(target=stats_printer, args=(stats_queue,))
stats_thread.start()

so the stats_printer is running on the stats_thread which just takes
stats_queue and processes it along the rest of the program

the ReplayProcessor function is what looks like first opens up the replay
once it get to line 184:
self._print("SC2 Started successfully.")
it looks like that is when it begins, here is where it prints that
general information to console

              if valid_replay(info, ping):
                self.stats.replay_stats.maps[info.map_name] += 1
                for player_info in info.player_info:
                  self.stats.replay_stats.races[
                      sc_pb.Race.Name(player_info.player_info.race_actual)] += 1
                map_data = None
                if info.local_map_path:
                  self._update_stage("open map file")
		  map_data = self.run_config.map_data(info.local_map_path)

I am not really sure how that ends up being printed to console but whatever
the real details of the game are just after this on line 216
self.process_replay(controller, replay_data, map_data, player_id)
