This file is for help on installing SC2LE on Ubuntu 16.04.1 Linux
or StarCraft II Learning Enviorment
this allows StarCraft II to be used for AI research

SC2LE consist of 3 parts
1: An opensource toolset called PySC2 for buidling models
2: Machine Learning API from Blizzard for SC2
3: A large dataset of SC2 game replays, for training models

Here are the links where you can find these things
1: https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2
2: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto
3: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#replay-packs

There is also a paper by DeepMind outlining the release
https://deepmind.com/documents/110/sc2le.pdf

---------------------------------------
1: PySC2

The easiest way to install this is
$ sudo pip3 install PySC2

---------------------------------------
2: ML API for StarCraft2
Additionally, there is a headless (without graphics) build of SC2 for Linux
https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads

Download it, and unzip like this, which is where PySC2 will look for it by defualt
$ unzip -d ~/ Downloads/SC2.3.16.1.zip

You will also want maps and mini-games
Maps: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads
Get all 4 maps listed here and you'll want to unzip them like this
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/Ladder2017Season1.zip
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/Ladder2017Season2.zip
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/Ladder2017Season3.zip
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/Melee.zip

Minigames go in the same way
Minigames: https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2#get-the-maps
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/mini_games.zip

---------------------------------------
3: Replay Packs
And of course you will want training data (game replays)
https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#replay-packs
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII Downloads/3.16.1-Pack_1-fix.zip

---------------------------------------
Validate your enviorment
This runs an agent to test your enviorment
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.agent --map Simple64

More agents
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.agent --map CollectMineralShards --agent pysc2.agents.scripted_agent.CollectMineralShards

Play as a human
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.play --map Simple64

Watch a game replay (from dataset)
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.play --replay <path-to-replay>

Maps need to be configured before they are known to the enviorment
See maps known with
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.map_list


Alright, if those ran for you with the GUI and everything then you
are totally set up.
