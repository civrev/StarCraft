This file is for help on installing SC2LE on Ubuntu 16.04.1 Linux
or StarCraft II Learning Enviorment edit
this allows StarCraft II to be used for AI research

SC2LE consist of 3 parts
1: An opensource toolset called PySC2 for buidling models
2: Machine Learning API from Blizzard for SC2
3: A large dataset of SC2 game replays, for training models

Here are the links where you can find these things
1: https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2
2: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto
3: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#replay-packs

There is also a paper by DeepMind outlining the release
https://deepmind.com/documents/110/sc2le.pdf

---------------------------------------
1: PySC2

The easiest way to install this is
$ sudo pip3 install PySC2

---------------------------------------
2: ML API for StarCraft2
Additionally, there is a headless (without graphics) build of SC2 for Linux
https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads

Download it, and unzip like this, which is where PySC2 will look for it by defualt
$ unzip -d ~/ Downloads/SC2.3.16.1.zip

You will also want maps and mini-games
Maps: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads
Get all 4 maps listed here and you'll want to unzip them like this
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/Ladder2017Season1.zip
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/Ladder2017Season2.zip
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/Ladder2017Season3.zip
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/Melee.zip

Minigames go in the same way
Minigames: https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2#get-the-maps
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII/Maps Downloads/mini_games.zip

---------------------------------------
3: Replay Packs
And of course you will want training data (game replays)
https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#replay-packs
$ unzip -d ~/StarCraftII Downloads/3.16.1-Pack_1-fix.zip

---------------------------------------
Validate your enviorment
This runs an agent to test your enviorment
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.agent --map Simple64

More agents
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.agent --map CollectMineralShards --agent pysc2.agents.scripted_agent.CollectMineralShards

Play as a human
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.play --map Simple64

Watch a game replay (from dataset)
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.play --replay <path-to-replay>

Maps need to be configured before they are known to the enviorment
See maps known with
$ python3 -m pysc2.bin.map_list


Alright, if those ran for you with the GUI and everything then you
are totally set up.
